# Take Home Project

## Brief Explanation of the Implementation

This project is a simple blog application built using React. It allows users to browse through blog posts, view individual blog details, and utilize a notification system on the bell counter. The main components of the application include:

- **Navbar**: Displays the application logo, notification bell, and sign-in/register buttons.
- **BlogList**: Fetches and displays a list of blog posts with basic information such as title, date, category, and a brief content preview. Users can click on a blog title to view its details.
- **BlogDetails**: Displays the full content of a selected blog post, including its title, thumbnail image, publication date, and category.

Also It has some static components like Reviews & Newsletter.

The application uses React Router for navigation and state management to handle notifications based on user interactions with the blog cards.
I used proper react file structure & reusable components.Also created Separate hooks.Made this responsive as per the requirement.
